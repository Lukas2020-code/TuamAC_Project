## Bugs

- ### Conatct website

  - In phone number input, user can also write a letters if use a laptop or desktop keyboard. For tablet and phones it shows a numeric keypad to write the number. I found out that not all browsers support input type="tel" and they fall back to standard text input.

- ### Thank you site
