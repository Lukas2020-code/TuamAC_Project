                <h1>History of Tuam AC</h1>
                <div class="inner-content">
                    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to various sources, the Tuam Athletics Club was founded either in 1899 or in 1910, which makes it one of the oldest athletic clubs in Ireland. At the beginning, all age groups were under one club - Tuam AC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1989 one coach - Paddy Gillmore (42 at that time) decided to open a juveniles section in Tuam AC which was according to his words <span class="quote">&#8220;the best decision I ever made&#8221;.</span> In the initial few weeks, juvenile section had only 8 athletes, but the number grew to over 100 after the first few months. At the beginning, Mickey Coleman helped Paddy with everything. Both in training sessions as well as in organizing competitions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These were times without telephones and computers. Therefore, communication of the training times and competition was much more challenging as nowadays. For kids to be able to take part in either training sessions or competitions, the coach had to inform them when, what time and where the training sessions were, as well as register athletes for competitions and go with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first training venue was the Old Court House at Dublin Road in Tuam. Over time, that place became too small for all young athletes and trainings were moved to St. Pat’s school grounds, behind the Court House. A decision was also made to split all kids into age groups categories and plan training sessions according to the age of the athletes. This wouldn’t be possible without the parent, who decided to join the club and together with coaches plan the training sessions. Like today, the trainings were held on Tuesday and Thursday evening and Sunday morning, unless there was a competition over the weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The club always had athletes in Galway and Connaught Championships, however getting to All-Ireland competition was a bigger challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the best know athletes from Tuam AC Juveniles back there is Ann-Marie Heinz (Miskell after husband), who won several gold medals for the club during her carrier between 1990-2000. She took part in Galway, Connaught, All-Ireland and Cross-Country Championships running long distances: 1,000m and 1,500m. She left the club after 2002-2003 season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second probably best known athlete is Shan Coleman, who won silver medals for u-15 in long distance: 1,500m in Cross-Country and All-Ireland Championships.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Today</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since 2012 The Juvenile Section is separate from Tuam AC and has its own club committee. Parents are the main force running the club and committing their time to ensure their kids can enjoy the trainings, improve their performance and take part in competitions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the club have strong representation of young athletes, who have won the medals not only in Galway, Connaught and All-Ireland competitions but also in International Championships abroad.
